**NOTE: THIS LIBRARY SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION**

Databinding cleaner is a Gradle plugin that modifies the sources generated by Android's DataBinding framework to automatically set Views held by bindings to null when they are no longer needed to remove memory leaks.
It uses terrible hacks to accomplish this and should **NOT** be used in production.

There are two main take aways from this:

1. If you keep a reference to a binding in a Fragment, you **MUST** set it to `null` in `onDestroyView()`
2. The same is true for `RecyclerView.Adapters` and `ViewPagerAdatpers` (only if you keep a reference to them)

If you do not want to make your `Binding` nullable, you can use something like [`AutoClearedValue`](https://github.com/android/architecture-components-samples/blob/master/GithubBrowserSample/app/src/main/java/com/android/example/github/util/AutoClearedValue.kt)
as proposed [here](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/153613055).
